# Explore the types of Azure Data Science Virtual Machines

## Windows-Based Data Science VMs
There are no software charges for the DSVM image. You pay only the Azure usage fees, and those depend on the size of the virtual machine you provision.

The Windows-based DSVM includes some features that are not available on the Linux-based DSVM.

- Tutorials available for training purposes.
- Support for Microsoft Office.
- SQL Server integrated with Machine Learning Services to support Python/R execution with SQL Server.

## Deep Learning Virtual Machine

### Simplify tasks with DLVMs
Creating a neural network can be difficult because there are many tools that a data scientist could use to complete that task. This can be intimidating. The DLVM simplifies that process by including preconfigured tools for different situations.

### Key features
Key features of DLVMs include:

- All tools that are included in a Linux-based DSVM
- Deep-learning tools
- GPU-based VMs
- Catalog of tools and samples
- Samples of different deep-learning scenarios

## Geo AI Data Science VM with ArcGIS
The Geo AI DSVM is a version of the Windows DSVM specially configured to support geospatial artificial intelligence and is offered through the collaboration between Esri and Microsoft. Geospatial artificial intelligence (Geo AI) refers to the incorporation of machine learning in mapping, map interpretation, or any machine learning with geographical content.

ArcGIS Pro is Esri's next-generation 64-bit desktop geographic information system (GIS). , ArcGIS Pro is technologically ahead of everything else on the market, and provides professional 2D and 3D mapping in an intuitive user interface. 

The Geo AI DSVM augments the Windows DSVM with the rich geospatial capabilities of ArcGIS Pro.

### Tools included
The Geo AI DSVM offers a large set of tools for machine learning, which are also offered in other DSVM versions.

Some of the Deep learning tools included in Geo AI DSVM are:
- Deep-learning frameworks such as:
- TensorFlow
- Cognitive Toolkit
- Torch
- Chainer
- Keras
- Caffe2
- A standalone instance of Spark

### Examples of Geo AI
- Real-time results of traffic conditions
- Driver availability in Uber or Lyft at any time
- Deep learning for disaster response
- Urban growth prediction
- Even more examples are available on the Geo AI DSVM.
